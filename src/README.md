  > The SHOW_GUI should be False if you are using script in a remote terminal (e.g. Amazon EC2) which can not have GUI elements. 
- Install the required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Executing the script
- Simply run `python3 visa1.py`
  > If running on a remote terminal that does not have GUI (e.g. Amazon EC2), use `screen` command first to run it on a separate screen. Press `CTRL+a` and then `d` to detach from the screen, once the script is running. The script will keep running in the background. Use `screen -ls` to get your screen number. You can go back to screen by using `screen -r 12345` (replace 12345 with your actual screen number).
- That's it!
